# Random Time
This is a simple time scheduling app built with Vue, Express and PostgreSQL.

It allows you to specify which activities you want to spend time on, optionally weighed by percentage, and create a randomized schedule for you.

This app is very much tailored to my own specific intentions, so it might not be of great use to everyone, but feel free to try it out and adapt if you like.
